# d3.angular2
Generic Angular 2 components for data presentation in D3.js that follow accepted best practices for Angular 2 and responsive D3 design.
# Work in Progress
This repository does not currently contain functional components, but stay tuned!
# What to Expect
d3.angular2 components will follow best practices for Angular 2 development, including:
- Static Typing with TypeScript
- Separation of Concerns
- Customizability
- 'Trickle down' component implementation

d3. angular2 components will also follow the following conventions commonly used in D3 workflows:
- Responsive width-based scaling using `seamlessRedraw()` functions
- Data binding with D3's integrated `data()` function
